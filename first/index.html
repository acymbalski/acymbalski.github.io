            <i><h5>
                Mostly geared towards younger students, but simple to use, understand, and get familiar with basic logic flows and programming basics.<br>
                In general, most of the courses should be fine, but <a href="https://class42.com/robotrattle.html">Robot Battle</a> would be a good start, and <a href="https://www.educative.io/collection/13890001/5677350838599680">here</a> is a Java specific tutorial.<br><br>
            </h5></i>
            <a href="https://repl.it/languages/java">Repl.it</a><br>

                Use this website if you "just want to code" and figure some stuff out. We briefly used this on 10/16/2018 to test out some Python basics; this link will take you straight to a functioning Java program you can mess around with.<br><br>

                Here's an example program that covers variables, inputs, outputs, methods, etc.<br>
                It uses a lot of different concepts, so don't worry if you can't understand what everything does just yet. But it may be useful in the future to use it as a reference for loops, arithmetic, arrays, etc.<br><br>

            <a href="https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/">Java Cheatsheet</a>
            <i><h5>
                Uses a lot of terminology, and contains some programming concepts we won't need to touch on, but could be of some assistance.<br><br>
